A free (as in freedom) implementation of a heterogenous doubly linked list in C.  
It can be built as a static object with `make object` and linked to any program you want including doublylinkedlist.h.  
It is not by any mean secure or mature, and still lacks some functions, use with caution.  
Valgrind reports no memory leaks when correctly using the implementation (see main.c).
